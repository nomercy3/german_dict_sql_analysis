Hi!
These are just some SQL exercises I did to teach myself SQL.

## Data
Data for this research is German Nouns Dictionary. It is in the attached csv file, so you can run the querys by yourself.

## Instrumens
RDBMS is Postgresql. One should ask why haven't I consider Jupyter Notebook and to describe the analysis in Python. But I really wanted to teach myself SQL data manupulation with complex querys (well, relatively complex).

## Questions
Questions I asked myself during this research:
- How many characters in each word are?
- Distribution of these characters (cume dist)
- How many words starts with particular Letter
- Rank words by characters' number in each Letter-cluster
- Find the longest & smallest word in each Letter-cluster
- Average number of characters in each Letter-cluster
- Average number of characters in the whole dict
- What word comes 10 words after the longest word?
- Two rows before the smallest word?
- Count words' articles and rank them (der, die, das)
- Find all palindromes 

There are some questions, which I didn't include. But you can try to solve it by yourself:
- Find all anagrams
- Scrabble:  What 7 letters can you pick to spell the most 7 letter, 6 letter, 5 letter, 4 letter, 3 letter, 2 letter, and 1 letter words
- Scrabble: Now in Scrabble the letters you can select are limited to the tiles in the bag
- Scrabble: Now in Scrabble you can only use all of your letters without joining to another word if you go first. So add 8 letter words to the list.

## Thanks
Many thanks to a redditor, who encouraged me to do this. [The original post]https://www.reddit.com/r/SQL/comments/g4ct1l/what_are_some_good_resources_to_practice_sql/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf).
